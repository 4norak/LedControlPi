## Readme
This is a half-finished library for controlling the MAX7219/21 with an Arduino. The basic commands work, the Bit-Map is just incomplete and the code for accessing it (displayCharacter) has to be reworked, depending on how it is completed.  
Feel free to finish it if you like.  
Credits to Eberhard Fahle, whose Library "LedControl" I used as a base and modified to suit my needs.
