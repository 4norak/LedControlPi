## Readme
This is a library for controlling the MAX7219 and MAX7221 from a Raspberry Pi. Right now, there is no documentation available except for the header-file.  
Feel free to contribute to it if you like.  
Credits to Eberhard Fahle, whose Library "LedControl" I used as a base and modified to suit my needs.
