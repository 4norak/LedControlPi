## Readme
This is a half-finished library for controlling the MAX7219/21 with an Arduino. The basic commands work, the Bit-Map for the ASCII-Characters is just incomplete and the code for accessing it (LedDisplay::displayCharacter) has to be reworked, depending on how it is completed.  
Feel free to finish it if you like.  
Credits to Eberhard Fahle, whose Library "LedControl" I used as a base and modified to suit my needs.
